## The Programs

Below are the program behaviors you will study in different programming languages and with different implementations.

### Cat Detector

1. The user is prompted to input the word "cat"
1. If they do not input "cat", they are prompted again
1. If they do input "cat", the program ends

### Reverse and/or Repeat

1. The user inputs some text
1. The user is prompted to input "repeat", "reverse" or "repeat reverse"/"reverse repeat"
1. Depending on the user's input, the program will:
   - "repeat" -> the text is printed n times on a new line
   - "reverse" -> the text is reversed
   - "repeat reverse"/"reverse repeat" -> the reversed text is printed on n lines
1. The program ends

### Average

1. The user inputs one number at a time
   - The program will ignore values that are not numbers
1. When they input "done", the program displays the average
1. The program ends

### Flashcards

1. The user creates a number of flashcards by inputting a question and an answer separated by `::`
1. When the user is finished creating flashcards, they input "done"
1. The user is then presented with a randomized questions and must input the correct answers
1. When all questions are answered, the user's results is presented
1. The program ends.

### Multiple Choice Quiz

1. The user creates questions for the quiz:
   1. The user inputs the question, then one possible answer at a time:
      1. The answer + whether the answer is correct/incorrect
      1. When they are finished adding answers to a question they type "done
   1. When the user is finished adding questions, they type "done"
1. The user is presented with one question + possible answers at a time
   - to answer a question, they type the letter of their answer choice
1. When all the questions are answered, feedback is displayed and the program ends
